Favorite CPSC 120L labs

*Lab 3 part 2

 My favorite labs were lab 3, part 2. I liked lab three part two because it was changing it from a Gregorian calendar to another calendar (Julian). We also had to change the day from a Gregorian calendar to a Julian day. We also changed the year and month of it to make it into a Julian month and year. 

*Lab 2 part 2

 My second favorite lab was lab two part two. The reason it is on here is because we learned how to add a singular verb as well as a present tense verb. Another reason I liked this part was because it taught us how plural nouns, singular nouns, and present tense verbs work in coding.

*lab 9,part two

 My last favorite lab was lab nine part two. This is one of my favorite labs because we tested two strings representing the eat-sleep schedule of two philosophers from a valid schedule. Another reason I liked this lab was because we learned what bool does.
